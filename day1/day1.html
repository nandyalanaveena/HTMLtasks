    <h1 style="color: red"><center>The Best Novels in English</center></h1>
    <h2 style="color: blue">1. Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe (1958)</h2>
    <p>
      It’s the ideal postcolonial novel. Its inventive idiomatic prose
      highlights the malleability of the English language: no other writer (or
      translator) has evoked the true essence of another language in English.
      Period.

      2. The God of Small Things by Arundhati Roy (1997)
    </h2>
    <p>
      As a non-native English speaker and someone who grew up in an Asian
      culture, English as a language appears very articulate and clear to me.
      And most well written English literature works, including poems, embody
      such almost straightforward characters, both in their wording and
      storytelling ... until I read Arundhati Roy's The God of Small Things. I
      still remember how struck I was to see the English words be played in a
      way that's mostly familiar to me in other Asian literature. The gentle
      singsong wording and wave-like storytelling combined with the vividness of
      English captured me like a dream. I've read many more English novels
      since, some as captivating and clever, but none carries the same magic.

    <h2 style="color: blue">3. Beloved by Toni Morrison (1987)</h2>
    <p>
      Beloved is one of the greatest novels ever written – in any language or
      culture, any genre or generation, any time or clime. It is a measure of
      Morrison’s rare and remarkable gift as a writer that one can say of this
      innovative novel: all humanity is here. It is the most extraordinary
      excavation of the bones and ghosts of American history (slavery, lynching,
      Jim Crow segregation), limned in a deeply haunting, profoundly moving
      multi-layered epic tragedy. With compelling candour, courage and
      conviction, Morrison's imperishable masterpiece distils an eerie evocation
      of mood, setting, landscape and atmosphere, a complex, even complicated
      deployment of character and characterisation, multiple points of view from
      an interlude of astutely individuated voices.

      4. The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood (1985)
    </h4>
    <p>
      Despite the passage of time, I have not forgotten how prescient The
      Handmaid’s Tale was, and how prescient it felt. She described a future
      that didn’t seem so far-fetched. Living in America gives you a sense,
      sometimes, that the fundamentalist Christians, with their literalist
      readings of the Bible, would be capable of reading the story of an
      infertile woman who had her husband impregnate her handmaid and see that
      as a solution to infertility in the modern age. And Atwood not only gets
      the reading of the Bible correct, she also foresaw that we would wreck the
      planet at the level of reproduction, too. Sometimes, when another “crazy”
      thing comes to pass in American politics/culture, I find myself thinking
      that we're moving closer to Atwood’s nightmare future. If you combine that
      prescience with Atwood's deft handling of language – she really is a prose
      virtuosa – and you have the making of a classic.

    <h2 style="color: blue">5. Blood Meridian by Cormac McCarthy (1985)</h2>
    <p>
      McCarthy is certainly one of the finest living authors in the world today
      and this novel is his best ... A Texan, his dark descriptions of the
      American West are second to none. His voice is unique and unmatched in its
      originality. This is a novel which hypnotises, horrifies and leaves the
      reader as dazed as man who has stood too close to freight-train as it has
      roared by his head. Jolting and vividly spattered with blood, the pages
      brand themselves deeply into the readers memory and imagination: A true
      American masterpiece crafted by a true master.
